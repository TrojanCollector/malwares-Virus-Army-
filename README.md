# malwares


A small collection of malware, I will add more viruses soon.
the files will be given in .zip archives ,to unlock them you gotta extract them with 7zip ,winrar or other archive manager and type: infected (this is the unlocking phrase)
I got the samples from these sources :
https://www.malshare.com/search.php
https://bazaar.abuse.ch/
https://github.com/Endermanch/MalwareDatabase
https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo
https://github.com/ashishb/android-malware
https://github.com/sk3ptre/AndroidMalware_2019
https://github.com/sk3ptre/AndroidMalware_2020
https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/
http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/mdl.php
https://zonefiles.io/all-registered-domains/
and some more ....

Anyway , I am uploading this repository to github for research purposes to make it a little easier for people interested in malware research to get some samples and know from which sites and repositories to get them .

The zip files contain mostly live malware and  you should research them with caution as some are from the recent years so they can surely exploit and penetrate your devices or entire network if used carelessly (for example ragnar ransomware is known to wreak havoc an attack the network of the device that executed it). So generally test only on virtual machine or sandbox and turn the VM `s internet off before execution of any malware , so that it does not spread and kill your neighbours`router or encrypt their devices :)

HOW YOU USE THESE SAMPLES IS ONLY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE TO ANY DAMAGE CAUSED TO DEVICES OR NETWORKS .
